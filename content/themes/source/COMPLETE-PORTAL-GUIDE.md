# Complete Custom Portal System Guide

## Overview
I've created a complete custom portal system that replaces Ghost Portal entirely with three beautiful modals:

1. **Membership Modal** - Shows all your tiers for signup/upgrade
2. **Sign-in Modal** - Handles member authentication
3. **Account Modal** - Manages member account details

All modals:
- Match your theme's design
- Include Turnstile protection (where applicable)
- Prevent Ghost Portal from appearing
- Work seamlessly with Ghost's Members API

## The Three Modals

### 1. Membership Modal (Signup/Upgrade)
- **Triggers**: "Subscribe" and "Upgrade" buttons
- **Features**:
  - Displays all your membership tiers (free and paid)
  - Grid layout (side-by-side on desktop)
  - Clones exact tier data from your homepage
  - Turnstile protection on all forms
  - Redirects to checkout for paid tiers

### 2. Sign-in Modal
- **Triggers**: "Sign in" buttons and links
- **Features**:
  - Clean, minimal design
  - Magic link authentication (passwordless)
  - Email sent confirmation message
  - Link to switch to signup
  - Auto-focuses email field

### 3. Account Management Modal
- **Triggers**: "Account" buttons when logged in
- **Features**:
  - Shows member details (email, name, plan, join date)
  - Manage Billing button for paid members
  - Upgrade button for free members
  - Sign out functionality
  - Prompts sign-in if not logged in

## How It Works

### Portal Action Mapping:
- `data-portal="signup"` → Membership Modal
- `data-portal="upgrade"` → Membership Modal
- `data-portal="signin"` → Sign-in Modal
- `data-portal="account"` → Account Modal

### Authentication Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign in"
2. Enters email in custom modal
3. Receives magic link via email
4. Clicks link to authenticate
5. Returns to site logged in

### Subscription Flow:
1. User clicks "Subscribe"
2. Sees all tiers in modal
3. Fills out form with Turnstile
4. For paid tiers: Redirected to Ghost Portal checkout
5. Completes payment via Stripe

## Testing Each Modal

### Test Membership Modal:
1. Click any "Subscribe" button
2. Should see all your tiers
3. Try subscribing to free tier
4. Try paid tier (redirects to checkout)

### Test Sign-in Modal:
1. Click "Sign in" button
2. Enter your email
3. Check email for magic link
4. Click link to sign in

### Test Account Modal:
1. When logged in: Click "Account"
   - Should see your member details
   - Can manage billing or sign out
2. When logged out: Click "Account"
   - Should prompt to sign in
   - Sign in button opens sign-in modal

- Try signing out and back in

### Tiers not showing?

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used:
- `/members/api/send-magic-link/` - Sign in/up
- `/members/api/member/` - Get member details
- `/members/api/signout/` - Sign out
- `/members/api/tiers/` - Get tier data
- `/members/api/member/stripe_portal/` - Billing management

### Modal Z-Index Hierarchy:
- Ghost Portal: 10000000
- Custom Modals: 10000001+
- Ensures modals always appear on top

### Event Interception:
- Removes `data-portal` attributes
- Prevents default link behavior
- Handles hash navigation
- Monitors DOM for new elements

## Customization

### Change Modal Titles/Text:
Edit the HTML strings in `portal-bypass.js`:
- Membership modal: Lines 20-21
- Sign-in modal: Lines 35-36
- Account modal: Line 58

### Modify Styles:
All styles are in the `styles` variable in `createModal()` function.

### Add Custom Features:
The modals use standard HTML/CSS, so you can:
- Add fields to forms
- Change layouts
- Add animations
- Customize colors

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
- Remember me functionality
- Social login integration
- Profile editing
- Subscription history
- Download invoices
- Cancel subscription flow

## Important Notes

1. **Email Configuration**: Sign-in requires proper email setup in Ghost Admin
2. **Stripe Integration**: Paid subscriptions require Stripe configuration
3. **Magic Links**: Links expire after a set time
4. **Session Management**: Ghost handles sessions automatically
5. **GDPR Compliance**: Member data is handled securely via Ghost's API

## Summary

You now have a complete custom portal system that:
- Replaces all Ghost Portal functionality
- Matches your theme perfectly
- Provides better user experience
- Gives you full control over the UI
- Works seamlessly with Ghost's backend

All portal actions are intercepted and handled by your custom modals, providing a cohesive, branded experience for your members!
